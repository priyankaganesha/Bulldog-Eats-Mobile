Bulldog Eats - Mobile
===================================


Abstract
--------------

There is often excess food that food providers need to handle after catered events on the Bellevue College campus. With Bulldog Eats, food providers will be able to make posts to notify students of the excess food from their events. This is a student led, student run project to connect hungry students with free excess food. By developing Bulldog Eats, we will help reduce food waste, contribute to the Bellevue College sustainability goals, and have a positive environmental and social impact on the campus community.
